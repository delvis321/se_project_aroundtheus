**Intro**

This project is a website for users to create a profile and share pictures for others to see and like. The project was created using HTML and CSS. Media queries were also used so the page can be viewed on mulitple screen sizes.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
